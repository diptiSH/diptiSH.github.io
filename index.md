## About Me

I am a post-doctoral research fellow in the <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/science/seos/index.php/">School of Earth and Ocean Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/">University of Victoria</a>.
My research interest lies in <b> climate dynamics and variability </b>. The central theme of my research
has been how large-scale dynamics interact with local factors to produce unique regional climates.
